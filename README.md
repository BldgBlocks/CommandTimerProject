# Command Timer - Timing & Organization of Commands #
  
Organize your complex commands that can take a lot of time, research, trial and effort.
Use friendly naming, description, ordering, categorizing, and coloring to help sort and find
what you are looking for. You can also share your libraries with others.

## Introduction ##

Commands can be obscure and pain-staking to figure out. Something simple is hard again in 6 months... I wanted something to help ease my way into Linux.
Command Timer aims to help organize your hard-won commands and tasks. Adding helpful features such as running your commands on time, as specified,
in a very flexible and transparent way. Command Timer provides some friendly ways to remember where you put things no matter how you like to arrange them.

## Notice ##

This project is still in development. It is functional, but features are still being added. See the roadmap below.

- Linux theme colors are not detected (Windows is supported) and will require something to parse them
- User memorable image tag per item
